/* Oh-oh
Ayy Royce, you did it right here
Still poppin' Xans, 2019
Pour up the lean, got me stuck in a dream
Started hittin' licks back in 2014
I got the ice on me, dripping Céline
Flawless came in off a hun'
Me and my niggas still drippin' for fun
Been knew I was the one

Six on a new fit, fifty for a drop top
I was off a bean, the Tech made me Wock' talk
Never been a lame, ain't shit to make her top drop
Smokin' on gas, ooh, I lift off

I hit her two times, then you niggas can have it
My young niggas pull up and shoot like the Magic
